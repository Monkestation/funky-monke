# Reporting a security vulnerability
If the security vulnerability is relevant to all SS14 servers, please communicate it to the mainline SS14 development team:
Through email, you can contact them at <telecommunications@spacestation14.com>.
Through Discord, you can join [their server](https://discord.gg/MwDDf6t) and then **privately** message anyone with the `@Wizard` or `@SS14 Maintainer` role.

If the security vulnerability is purely relevant to Boomerstation, please contact a maintainer on Github or contact us on [our Discord Server](https://discord.com/invite/monkestation)

In either case, **do not publicly disclose the vulnerability until we explicitly give you permission to do so**.
This gives time to update and patch the vulnerability before bad actors can exploit it.
